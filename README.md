# NXOpen-CAE-python

This repository is no longer maintained, but the code is kept for reference.

Instead of the journal approach in this repository, we created a dedicated python package called **nxopentse**.

With this package, you can immediately use the functions within your own journals, without the need to have the function code itself in your journal. Not only is this a much better approach for version control and traceability, but you also get the power of the comminity behind **nxopentse**.
